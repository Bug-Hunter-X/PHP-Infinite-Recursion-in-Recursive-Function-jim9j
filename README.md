This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in PHP programming: infinite recursion in a recursive function due to a missing base case. The `bug.php` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.php` provides the corrected version.  The bug is a subtle one that can be difficult to spot, especially in more complex recursive functions.  Understanding base cases and their importance in recursive functions is critical for writing robust and error-free code.
